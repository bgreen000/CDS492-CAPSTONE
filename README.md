# CDS492-CAPSTONE PROJECT
Benjamin Green (2023) 

GOAL AND PURPOSE

This research project aims to explore the relationship between divorce trends across the globe
and accompanying suicide rates. Unlike previous studies which are largely based on localized
comparisons of divorce and suicide rates, the study will seek to analyze differences across
several countries in order to more effectively account for covariates. Furthermore, again, unlike
previous studies, the focus will not simply be on the rates of these two variables, rather, the
variation in index scores for divorce freedom will be compared to corresponding suicide rates.
Using this explanatory variable instead of simply using divorce rates allows for more applicable
interpretation. Since divorce rates cannot be manipulated but only observed, unless there exists a
thorough understanding of its own explanatory variables, establishing correlations between such
rates does little in the way of providing a solution. However, if the confounding variables can be
adequately accounted for, which the inclusion of several countries hopes to accomplish, then
identifying the nature of the relationship between divorce freedom and suicide rates could
potentially provide real solutions since policy regarding divorce can be altered to produce
optimal outcomes.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED

This analysis will be conducted using R and two datasets containing information on global suicide 
rates and human freedom index scores. 

To obtain the global suicide dataset:
1. Visit https://ourworldindata.org/suicide
2. Scroll down to "Key insightes on suicide data & research." On the right, there is a graph with a download
option. 
3. Click download and then select "Full data (CSV)."  


To obtain the global human freedom index data:
1. Visit https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index/2022.
2. Download the xlsx version of the data. It is located at the top of the box on the left
